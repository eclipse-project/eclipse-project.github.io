  Eclipse is a support group for LGBTI+ and Queer refugees in Thessaloniki. We
  want to create a safe space, where refugees can connect within themselves and
  to the local LGBTI+ community.

      At the core of our work is a weekly meeting, to create a safe space for
      LGBTI+ refugees in the city centre of Thessaloniki. The space is not
      publicly listed as our highest priority is to create an environment that
      ensures safety and anonymity.

      The safe space is co-created by LGBTI+ refugees and members of the local
      LGBTI+ community. We aim on one hand to connect LGBTI+ refugees within
      themselves and on the other hand to connect them to the local community.
      The safe space is a place to discuss issues such as gender identity,
      sexual orientation, relationships, coming out and cultural diversity but
      it is also a place to meet like minded people and to enjoy an evening
      without fear of being judged.

      Another pillar of our work is the language classes. Many members of the
      group face discrimination in other educational spaces. They stopped
      joining these groups and are therefore left without any education. This is
      why we decided to offer language classes in small groups, in order to meet
      their needs as good as possible.

      Once a week one of the group members is conducting an aerobic or dance
      class, which enables people to get some physical activity and is a good
      way to reduce stress. Apart from this we organise other activities like
      beach trips, birthday parties or other excursions.

      We connect the members of our group to other organisations, which can
      support them in other needs. Through our network we can refer them to the
      following services

      In order for the members of our group to not lose their support, when they
      leave Greece, we are building a network of initiatives all over Europe,
      which are supporting LGBTI+ refugees. This enables us to refer members of
      our group to other support networks.

      We have been working with LGBTI+ refugees in Thessaloniki for more than a
      year and in that time have created a group that sustains itself and is
      co-conducted by the group members themselves.
