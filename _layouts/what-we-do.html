          At the core of our work is a weekly meeting, to create a safe space for LGBTI+ refugees in the city center of Thessaloniki. The space is not publicly listed as our highest priority is to create an environment that ensures safety and anonymity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The safe space is co-created by LGBTI+ refugees and members of the local LGBTI+ community. We aim on one hand to connect LGBTI+ refugees within themselves and on the other hand to connect them to the local community. The safe space is a place to discuss issues such as gender identity, sexual orientation, relationships, coming out and cultural diversity but it is also a place to meet like minded people and to enjoy an evening without fear of being judged.

          Another pillar of our work is the language classes. Many members of the group face discrimination in other educational spaces. They stopped joining these groups and are therefore left without any education. This is why we decided to offer language classes in small groups, in order to meet their needs as good as possible.

          Once a week one of the group members is conducting an aerobic or dance class, which enables people to get some physical activity and is a good way to reduce stress. Apart from this we organize other activites like beach trips, birthday parties or other excursions.

          In order for the members of our group to not lose their support, when they leave Greece, we are building a network of initiatives all over Europe, which are supporting LGBTI+ refugees. This enables us to refer members of our group to other support networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have been working with LGBTI+ refugees in Thessaloniki for more than a year and in that time have created a group that sustains itself and is co-conducted by the group members themselves.
