Last week we continued the education sessions on Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs). We started a few months ago with a workshop that focused mainly on HIV and different types of Hepatitis. This week we expanded on other STDs like Syphilis, HPV and others. We talked about their symptoms, how they can be treated and how to best prevent them.

Because of the Stigma that is surrounding sex, many people donâ€™t know a lot about STDs. Sexual education is many times overlooked - not only in the refugee context. We want to create a safe space, where our members can get as much information about their own bodies as possible and learn how to protect themselves and how to get treated.
