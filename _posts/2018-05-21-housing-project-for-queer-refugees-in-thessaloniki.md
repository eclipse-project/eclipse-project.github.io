Our sofas are not enough – Let’s get houses for Queer Refugees in Thessaloniki! Support our Crowdfunding campaign!

Eclipse supports LGBTI+ and Queer Refugees in many different ways. One need that has become more urgent and that we are struggling to cover is housing. Many people are not able to get accommodation provided by the government and bigger NGOs. There is just not enough space or the bureaucracy leads to waiting periods of several months. So either they stay on the street or have to wait in one of the refugee camps, where they suffer from daily homo- and transphobic discriminations and attacks. Even the ones who are now in official housing face eviction after several months of receiving their asylum.

We tried hosting our friends on our sofas, but first of all this can only be a temporary solution, which can’t lead to any stability and secondly there are just not enough sofas available. Having a roof over your head, is one of the most basic needs a person has, specially for vulnerable people like LGBTI+ refugees. Depriving a person of a home, violates a number of our so appreciated human rights. Therefore we want all our group members to have a roof over their head.

Help us to get two appartments, that could host up to eight people. Donate to our Fundraiser! If you are not able to help us financially, please share this link, tell your friends about it, invite people to like our page, organize a bakesale or whatever you can think of that can support this cause. Eternal love for you will be guaranteed.
